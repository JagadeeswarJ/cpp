Static functions can be accessed via objects too (even though it's not recommended).

When an object of class C is being instantiated, constructor of class B is called, which will
 again call constructor of class A that will print A B first. Then the data member of class C is
 created, which will again print A then print B. Then at last C is printed from the constructor of
class C. After the end of main() function, reverse of already printed sequence will be printed
from the destructor of the classes. So, the answer is c).
